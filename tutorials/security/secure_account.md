- crack by answer security questions -> passwd reset
- brute force attack

## Fundamental Security Concepts


### HTTPS

- authenticity = be sure you are on the site you think you are
- integrity = info send/receive is not manipulated. not MID attack
- confidentiality = others can't read the data you send

### Brute force attack

- eg. try to login multiple times

### Account enumeration attacks

- eg. answer - account didn't exists

### CSRF

- will do an action on your name on a site you are log on

### Event logging

Log :
- who : done the action
- action : what was doing
- when 
- from where
- with what
- via where - referer

## Password storage
