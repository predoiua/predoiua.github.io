## Balance sheet B/S

- CA = Current assets = Inventories(stocks) + Accounts receivable + Cash + Miscellaneous
- OF = Owners funds

- CL = Current liabilities = Account payables(creditors) + Short-term loans + Miscellaneous

### Balance sheet terms

- CE = Capital Employed = FA + CA - CL = OF + LTL
- NW = Net worth =  FA + CA - CL - LTL = OF
- WC = Working capital = CA - CL = OF + LTL - FA
It is the amount of day-to-day operating liquidity available to a business.
